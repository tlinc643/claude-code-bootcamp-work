## Start here

New to this repo? Pick the path that matches you:

- **Never used Claude Code, or want a gentle on-ramp** → Take the free **Claude Code 101** beginner workshop (~210 minutes, 8 short modules + quiz + capstone). Start at [beginner-student-guide.md](beginner-student-guide.md). Deck index: [slides/beginner/README.md](slides/beginner/README.md). Instructors: [beginner-instructor-guide.md](beginner-instructor-guide.md).
- **Comfortable with Claude Code and ready for production workflows** → Jump into the 5-hour intermediate bootcamp below.

## Overview

Most developers use AI as autocomplete. This bootcamp teaches you to use **Claude Code** as a development partner — one that plans, codes, tests, reviews, refactors, and documents alongside you. Across **10 hands-on projects** in a single afternoon you will ship a CLI, a REST API, a test suite, a UI from a wireframe, a refactor with handoff docs, a Git workflow, a personal skills library, and a production readiness review.

You leave with: a portfolio of 10 deliverables, a reusable Claude Skills library (10+ skills, MIT-licensed), and a **Packt Certification** Certificate of Completion.

## Audience

- Beginner-to-intermediate developers
- Tech leads adopting AI-assisted workflows
- DevOps and automation engineers
- AI-first builders moving from prompts to shipped software

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming literacy in any language
- Git basics (`clone`, `branch`, `commit`, `push`)
- Working **Claude Code** access (any tier)
- macOS / Linux / Windows-via-WSL2 — native PowerShell is not supported
- Python 3.11+ (primary track) and Node.js 20+ (secondary track for modules 2/4/5)
- ~30 minutes of mandatory **pre-work** completed before the live session — see [`student-guide.md`](student-guide.md#mandatory-pre-work-30-min)

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the bootcamp you can:

1. Drive Claude Code through plan → implement → test → review → commit loops
2. Write a `CLAUDE.md` brain file that gives Claude project context
3. Generate, evaluate, and select Best-of-N implementations
4. Generate test suites and detect AI-generated bugs
5. Run AI-assisted Git feature-branch workflows safely
6. Convert a wireframe into a working UI via multimodal prompts
7. Refactor a module under constraints and ship handoff docs
8. Author reusable Claude Skills and slash commands
9. Produce a 5-axis production readiness report
10. Self-review AI output against a Code Review Rubric you author

## Schedule

5 hours total = **4h instruction (240 min) + 1h breaks/Q&A/exam briefing (60 min)**.

## Projects

The 10 projects students build, in order:

1. **AI Coding Workspace** — repo + CLAUDE.md + first guided Claude Code run
2. **CLI Task Manager** — Python primary; Node.js secondary
3. **Project Brain File** — a real `CLAUDE.md` for an existing repo
4. **Notes App API** — Python (FastAPI + SQLite); Node.js (Hono + better-sqlite3)
5. **Tests + Bug Fixes + Code Review Rubric** — pytest + 2 bug fixes + a student-authored rubric
6. **Feature Branch Workflow** — feature branch + AI-generated commit + PR text
7. **Dashboard UI** — single-page UI rendered from a wireframe (Python)
8. **Refactor + Handoff Docs** — refactor a module + `HANDOFF.md` + `ARCHITECTURE.md` (Python)
9. **Personal Claude Skills / Command Library** — author at least one new SKILL.md
10. **Production Readiness Report** — 5-axis report on a prior project

> Module 5's "Code Review Rubric" is the **student-built deliverable** at [`exercises/part-05/code-review-rubric.md`](exercises/part-05/code-review-rubric.md). The **instructor grading rubric** lives at [`assessments/rubric.md`](assessments/rubric.md). They are different artifacts.

```

## Build

Build all 10 slide decks to PPTX (and optionally PDF/HTML):

```bash
cd slides
./deploy-pptx.sh            # PPTX only → slides/dist/pptx/
./deploy-pptx.sh --all      # PPTX + PDF + HTML → slides/dist/{pptx,pdf,html}/
./deploy-pptx.sh --pdf      # PPTX + PDF
./deploy-pptx.sh --clean    # remove dist/ before rebuilding
```

All decks (intermediate + beginner) build to a single flat tree under `slides/dist/<format>/`. Intermediate decks use the `wow-intermediate` theme (which `@import`s `wow-beginner`); beginner decks use `wow-beginner` directly. See [`slides/themes/README.md`](slides/themes/README.md).

The script auto-detects a global `marp` and falls back to `npx --yes @marp-team/marp-cli@latest`. Set `CHROME_PATH` if Marp can't find Chromium for PPTX/PDF export. See [`slides/README.md`](slides/README.md).

Validate repository structure (sections, terminology, durations, forbidden tokens):

```bash
bash scripts/validate.sh
```

## Assessment

| Component | Weight | Artifact |
|---|---:|---|
| Knowledge quiz | 40% | [`assessments/knowledge-quiz.md`](assessments/knowledge-quiz.md) |
| Practical task | 40% | [`assessments/practical-task.md`](assessments/practical-task.md) |
| Code review reflection | 20% | [`assessments/code-review-reflection.md`](assessments/code-review-reflection.md) |
| Pass threshold | **70%** | [`assessments/rubric.md`](assessments/rubric.md) |

Students who achieve ≥70% receive a **Packt Certification** Certificate of Completion issued from [`certificate-template.md`](certificate-template.md).

Submission workflow: students zip their deliverables (`module-00-prework/` + `module-01/` … `module-10/` + `assessments/`) and upload to the Packt LMS. Instructor grades locally — see [`instructor-guide.md`](instructor-guide.md).
